## Introduction

Hi! I'm **Miguel Pimentel**. I am a problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. I live in Minnesota, also known as the _"Land of 10,000 Lakes"_ for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

If you are aching for more, you can read the few [blog posts](https://miguelpimentel.do/) I've published, check out what [tools](https://forgetfulnotes.com/Tools) I use daily, or read my [public journal](https://forgetfulnotes.com/Public-Journal).
