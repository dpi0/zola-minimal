## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `theme.toml` and templates files in this repo for an idea.

In most cases you only need to modify the content in the `config.toml` file to
custom your blog, including different expressions in your speaking language.

### Custom CSS styles

Adding your custom css is as easy as adding your own styles to the `sass/_custom.scss` file.
